Behind.png shows the reflection of a scene in a sphere.
There is a point light in the corner.

Disco.png is a sphere constructed out of triangles.
You can infer that this is a collection of triangles (and not a sphere object)
since the outline of the shape is not smooth.
However, these are TriNormal objects with normal vectors that intersect
the center of the sphere. Thus, the shading is smooth across the triangles since normals are interpolated.
Only half of the triangles are displayed, and a reflective ball is in the center.
There are two point lights, red and blue, that create interesting effects in the reflecting ball.
The inside surfaces of the triangles are also reflective.
16x antialiasing is turned on. Nice!

Billiards.png is a set of 9 balls.
They change in color from blue to red in a zigzag pattern.
The balls have a nice surface with a specular highlight.
There is a recursion depth of 5, so you can identify which balls
are in each reflection.
They are on a reflective surface with a slight ambient light.
16x antialiasing is turned on.

This scene is inside of a box with low specularity,
and there is one attenuated point light.

You can vaguely see the reflection in the back wall.
The green ball is reflected in both the left and right mirrors.
The shadows are hard, which we can improve later.

bouncybounce.png is a refinement of the previous.
the mirrors have 0 ambient which gives better effects.
the bounce depth is set to 7.
The field of view is 80 which is why it looks somewhat unnatural.
you can see, in the reflections, the point light in a corner.
