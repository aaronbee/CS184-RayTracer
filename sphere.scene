# Test Scene 1 
# A simple quad viewed from different camera positions

size 1440 900

# Now specify the camera.  This is what you should implement.
# This file has 4 camera positions.  Render your scene for all 4.

#camera 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 1 0 30
#camera 0 -3 3 0 0 0 0 1 0 30
#camera -4 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 45
camera -4 -4 4 0 0 0 0 1 0 30

# lighting/material definitions
# for initial testing, you should get the geometry right
# you may want to use dummy (constant) shading, ignoring these lines

#ambient .1 .1 .1
#directional 0 0 1 .5 .5 .5 
point -4 -4 4 .7 .7 .7
#diffuse 1 0 0 
#specular 0 0 0

# Now specify the geometry 
# Again, for initial testing, maybe you want to implement a dummy 
# ray-plane intersection routine, instead of reading this fully.
# Though it's probably simpler you just implement this, for later 
# parts of the assignment.
